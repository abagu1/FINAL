<h3>Music with a Mission</h3>
	<h4>An organization that gives students performance opportunities while teaming up with different charities. All revenue made from concerts go to the organizations we have teamed with. </h4>
<br>
<h5>Music Industry Club</h5>
	<h6>A professional organization dedicated to providing the University of New Haven with musical entertainment. We find local artists to perform at various shows we host throughout the year, and give members experience in setting up for shows, running them, booking artists, and accommodating them when they come to perform. </h6>

<h7>Audio Engineering Society</h7>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h8>A group looking to enrich the education of anyone studying audio at the University. We provide student workshops in which experienced students and/or faculty lead demonsrations in the studio (including microphone shootouts, signal processing, and critical listening), field trips to professional studios, and composition and mixing competitions. This allows students to practice and grow as audio engineers outside of the classroom. </h8>
